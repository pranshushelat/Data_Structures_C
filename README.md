# Data_Structures_C
This is a repository for the data structures I practice.

The table of contents are as follows-

01. Linked Lists  
1.1 Singly Linked List  
1.2 Doubly Linked List  
1.3 Circular Linked List  
02. Stacks  
2.1 Stack (using Arrays)  
2.2 Dynamic Stack  
2.3 Stack (using Linked List)  
03. Queues  
3.1 Queue (using Array)  
3.2 Double Ended Queue  
3.3 Queue (using Linked List)  
04. Polish Notations  
4.1 Evaluating Prefix expression (Polish Notation)  
4.2 Evaluating Postfix expression (Reverse Polish notation)  
05. Binary Search Tree  

Each folder (or subfolder) contains the C source file and the executable compiled file. These files demonstrate basic operations in each of the data structures.
